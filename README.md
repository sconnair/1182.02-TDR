# 1182.02-TDR - The ZenPen

The ZenPen project was a design project I contributed heavily towards with my team from the Fundamentals of Engineering II course. My primary role was as the CAD prototype developer, while my teammates took on the roles of writing documentation and testing designs.

Over the course of the project, we went from concept art to clay prototype to a 3D printed iterations on our CAD model. In the end, we created a fully functioning pen with adjustable weights and an ergonomic grip, thereby dampening tremors for individuals in our target audience, victims of Parkinson's Disease.
