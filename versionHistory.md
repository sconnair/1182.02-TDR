## V3  
- **Weight/Time:** 32.2g, 2h18m  
- **Cost:** $8.74  

**Changes:**  
- Shifted loop higher on pen body to better fit finger contour  
- Shifted finger imprints towards pen tip to increase control  
- Widened diameter at body mid-portion to eliminate thin walls in V2  
- Adjusted pin tolerances (-0.02mm) for better body-weight cap interfacing  
- Attempted printing “ZenPen” branding around weight cap for aesthetic appeal

## V4 (3/30)  
- **Weight/Time:** 35.84g, 2h24m  
- **Cost:** $9.50  

**Changes:**  
- Created upward angle on bottom finger loop connector to match pointer finger grip angle  
- Increased loop radius for looser fit  
- Added cap for pen tip to prevent stray marks  
- Created new cap without text and with flattened top surface for cleaner printing  
- Adjusted pointer finger indentation angle for better fit

## V5 (4/2)  
- **Weight/Time:** 64g, 4h24m  
- **Cost:** $17.30  

**Purpose:**  
- Tested two weight rod diameters (7/32” and 1/8”) for recycled steel rods  

**Big Diameter Adjustments:**  
- Increased cartridge tolerance (+0.5mm) to reduce sanding  
- Increased weight hole diameter to 7/32"  

**Small Diameter Adjustments:**  
- Added 6th weight rod slot  
- Increased cartridge tolerance (+0.5mm)  
- Shifted top loop connection down for ergonomics  
- Decreased weight hole diameter to 1/8”

## V6 (4/3)  
- **Weight/Time:** 38.21g, 2h22m  
- **Cost:** $9.98  

**Changes:**  
- Chose big diameter rods from V5 for weight and feedback  
- Redesigned cap to slide over weights instead of pin insertions  
- Chose shifted-down top loop connection (from V5 small diameter) for ergonomics  
- Increased body diameter for larger rods and firmer hand seating

## V7 (4/8)  
- **Weight/Time:** 34.02g, 2h17m  
- **Cost:** $9.10  

**Changes:**  
- Increased rod hole tolerance (+0.1mm) for easier removal  
- Added cap connector draft to improve connection tightness  
- Rotated sweep sketch angle to better match finger loop curve

## V8 (4/11)  
- **Weight/Time:** 35.15g, 2h20m  
- **Cost:** $9.36  

**Changes:**  
- Increased chamfer angle and decreased weight cap tolerance (-0.2mm) for tighter fit  
- Added chamfer to weight holes for easier rod insertion

## V9 (4/15)  
- **Weight/Time:** 35.27g, 2h20m  
- **Cost:** $9.39  

**Changes:**  
- Reduced tolerance on weight cap (+0.0) to fix looseness issue  
- Removed chamfer from weight holes (did not print correctly)
